name: Auth0 brute-force protection disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when brute-force protection in Auth0 is disabled.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors Auth0 logs to identify when brute-force protection is turned off. This feature prevents a single IP address from repeatedly trying to log in to the same user account, which helps maintain the security of your application against credential-based attacks.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Investigate the client ID to determine if this action is expected.
  2. Collaborate with your tenant administrator to identify the application owner.
  3. Discuss with the application owner to confirm if this action was anticipated and approved.
  4. If the application owner is unaware of this action:
      * Disable the application credentials if possible.
      * Investigate any further activity from the IP address or the client ID.
      * Initiate your organization's incident response process and investigate further.
