name: Auth0 breached password detection disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when breached password detection in Auth0 is disabled.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Auth0 logs to identify when breached password detection is turned off. This feature protects applications from unauthorized access using stolen credentials, and disabling it increases vulnerability to credential-based attacks.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Investigate the client ID to determine if this operation is expected.
  2. Collaborate with the tenant administrator to identify the application owner.
  3. Speak with the application owner to confirm if the operation is approved.
  4. If the owner is unaware of this change:
      * Disable the application credentials if feasible.
      * Investigate any suspicious activity from the client IP or client ID.
      * Initiate your organization's incident response process.
