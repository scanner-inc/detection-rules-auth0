name: Auth0 user logged in with a breached password
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user logs in with a breached password.

  ## Strategy
  Auth0 logs an event when a user logs in with a breached password. When this event is detected, a `MEDIUM` severity Security Signal is generated.

  You can find more information on how Auth0 detects breached passwords in their documentation.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Inspect the policy and user location to see if this login is from an approved location.
  2. Verify if two-factor authentication was authenticated.
  3. If the user is compromised, rotate their credentials.
