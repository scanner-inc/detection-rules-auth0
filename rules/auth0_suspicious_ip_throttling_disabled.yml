name: Auth0 suspicious IP throttling disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when suspicious IP throttling is disabled in Auth0.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Auth0 logs to identify when suspicious IP throttling is turned off. This feature blocks IP addresses that attempt excessive logins or signups, protecting applications from high-velocity attacks, including brute force attacks and credential stuffing. Disabling it reduces application security and increases vulnerability.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Investigate the client ID to determine if the action is expected.
  2. Collaborate with your tenant administrator to find the application owner.
  3. Confirm with the application owner whether this operation is approved.
  4. If the owner is unaware:
      * Disable the application credentials if possible.
      * Investigate any further activity from the IP address or the client ID.
      * Initiate your organization's incident response process and proceed with the investigation.
